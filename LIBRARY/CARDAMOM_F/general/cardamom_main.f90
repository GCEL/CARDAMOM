 ! This code is based on the original C verion of the University of Edinburgh
 ! CARDAMOM framework created by A. A. Bloom (now at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory).
 ! All code translation into Fortran, integration into the University of
 ! Edinburgh CARDAMOM code and subsequent modifications by:
 ! T. L. Smallman (t.l.smallman@ed.ac.uk, University of Edinburgh)
 ! J. F. Exbrayat (University of Edinburgh)

 ! Created: Anthony A. Bloom
 ! Major modification history:
 ! Version 1.0: C language MHMCMC and io created by Anthony A. Bloom
 ! Version 1.1: Translated into Fortran, including some generic function replacement by T. L. Smallman
 ! Version 1.2: Analysis restart capacity added by T.L. Smallman
 ! Version 1.3: MHMCMC updated to APMCMC by T.L. Smallman with advice from Anthony A. Bloom
 !            : Following Haario et al., (2001, 2006) and Roberts & Rosenthal (2009).
 ! Version 1.4: Pre-APMCMC phase using normalised likelihoods added by T. L. Smallman
 !            : Pre-APMCMC allows for rapidly moving towards observations from very bad starting points.
 ! Specific citations for developments included in the code.

 ! This is the main subroutine for the CARDAMOM framework. The specific model
 ! method combinations are achieved through case specific compilation of the
 ! case while maintaining strict consistent io formats to allow for these
 ! combinations

 ! Command line inputs are:
 ! 1) file in
 ! 2) file out
 ! 3) integer number of solutions requested
 ! 4) print-to-screen frequency
 ! 5) write-to-file frequency
