## CARDAMOM Coupled Models

This files provides information on the currently coupled models within CARDAMOM. Table 1 provides a summary of the model name, alternate names used in publications and / or source code, publication containing the first or most complete description and status (e.g. published, under development, abandoned). The model name is the combination of the nominal model family (e.g. DALEC) and classifiers indicating the specific sub-models used. If an available classifier is not used in a given models name, please assume that option "0" is implicit. Sub-model specific information in summaries in subsequent tables. Both the model code name and a short code name contructed from the nominal model family and the reference code, e.g. "DALEC.D1.F2." == "DALEC.1.".

The current classifiers used are: 
A = Assimilation (Table 2)
C = C-cycle (Table 3)
D = Manual disturbance (Table 4)
F = Fire (Table 5)
H = Hydrology (Table 6)
N = N-cycle (Table 7)
P = Phenology (Table 8)
R = Respiration (Table 9)
M = Managed Grassland / arable crops (Table 10)

#### TABLE 1. CARDAMOM models, their intended reference for publications, the in-code name and various names previously applied. The details of each model should either be found in a designated peer-reviewed publication or by contacting a point of contact (POC).
